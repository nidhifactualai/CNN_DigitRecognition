# CNN_DigitRecognition
In this notebook, we will build a simple CNN-based architecture to classify the 10 digits (0-9) of the MNIST dataset. The objective of this notebook is to become familiar with the process of building CNNs in Keras.  We will go through the following steps:  Importing libraries and the dataset Data preparation: Train-test split, specifying the shape of the input data etc. Building and understanding the CNN architecture Fitting and evaluating the model
